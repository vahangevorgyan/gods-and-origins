# SEA Stage 2 - Gods and Origins Website 🗿

I created this website out of my passion for ancient mythology for the Snap Academy 2025 project assessment. It highlights gods from Greek, Egyptian, Norse, and Roman cultures, letting you explore and learn about them in a simple way. Click [here](https://vahangevorgyan.github.io/gods-and-origins/) to view the website:)
